     A checklist of things I needed to do:
1.	Numbers need to be to be shuffled on load or restart
2.	draw a table of 5x5, numbered from 1 to 25 (unsorted)
3.	Game should display the current number of moves a user has made
4.	The game should show a star rating (from 1–3) that reflects the player’s performance based on the number of moves made. 
5.	When a player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start and once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
6.	A restart button should allow the player reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
7.	A congratulations modal should appear the game, show its name and its score. when the player wins while showing a button to play again and modal should show: How much time it took, and star rating.
8.	Write the logic to show modal 
	



You’re developing a game in PHP for a client. First of all, the user has to enter its name and email. 


Then you have to draw a table of 5x5, numbered from 1 to 25 (unsorted). To sort the table the user has to click on two numbers to swap them. When the user finishes the game, show its name and its score. The user can click on “Retry” and starts the game again.

Some requirements and advices:
-Use this background: http://origin.uk.com/origin_background.jpg
- The score is 100 less the number of movements made by the user – e.g. if the user does 10 movements, the final score is 90.
- Feel free to use any technology apart from PHP (javascript, jQuery, bootstrap...).
- Beneficial: Use OO PHP or any framework such Code Igniter.
- Beneficial: Make the website responsive.
- There is no need to use databases.
- Don’t worry so much about the design.
- If you have any doubt, you can make any assumption you need (just write it down in a comment).

When you finish, compress the code (use RAR or ZIP), named it “NAME_SURNAME” and Wetransfer/email it to us
